## What the purpose of the repository?

Every day I improve my skills as an Android Developer:
- solve tasks from Leetcode
- research some methods of Kotlin/Java, look to their underhood
- try to use new features of platform and libraries
- collect useful examples code, ideas, etc. (references in the table below)

> I hope it will help me to switch from my current position to a new role as an Android Developer
